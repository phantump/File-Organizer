# File-Organizer
A File Organizer in Python
  This program reads a folder called finalproject, and inside that folder is two sub folders called Commander and Standard.
  Both sub folders are then broken into five more sub folders: White, Blue, Black, Red, Green
  The Organizer requires this folder layout unless you change the filepath in both the editor and organizer files.
